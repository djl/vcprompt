# Each patch is attributed to its author, usually by email address (for
# example, `Fred Bloggs <fred@example.net>').  Darcs looks in several
# places for this author string: the --author option, the files
# _darcs/prefs/author (in the repository) and ~/.darcs/author (in your
# home directory), and the environment variables $DARCS_EMAIL and
# $EMAIL.  If none of those exist, Darcs will prompt you for an author
# string and write it to _darcs/prefs/author.
